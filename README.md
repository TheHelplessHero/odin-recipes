This is an OdinProject... project... about recipes!
This will force me to build a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page with links to a few recipes. It won't look pretty but this is mainly to instill the very basics of HTML into my head.
Later I will come back to this for another project/assignment regarding CSS to make it look a bit better. No promises though!
